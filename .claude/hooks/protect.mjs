//   daytime  (ADOPTION_RUN unset)  nothing: exits 0, the normal permission flow decides
//   night    (ADOPTION_RUN=1)      denies a write under .claude/ (the harness: hooks, settings,

//                                  migrations, env files), and a write outside the repository.
//                                  Denies every MCP tool whose server is not named in

// The worker is the actor these hooks constrain; a control it can rewrite is prose. The Stop gate
// also reads adoption.json from the base branch, the runner refuses to push a branch where
// .claude/ moved, and the runner starts every session with --strict-mcp-config so only the
// servers in .claude/mcp.night.json exist at all - layers, because a text match is not a
// boundary on its own.
