// Stop hook: in an unattended run the session may not end while "done" is only an opinion.
//
// Order, cheapest failure last on purpose: the gate runs FIRST so the agent fixes code before it
// commits it; then nothing may have been loosened against the base branch (a green bought by a
// raised floor, a lowered threshold, a rule switched off or an edited hook is not green); then the
// tree must be clean (every step is a commit); then the newest source-touching commit on the
// branch must be followed or accompanied by a CHANGELOG touch; then the phase's entry in the state
// file must have been updated during this run. Any failure blocks the stop with exit 2 - the
// documented behaviour that blocks regardless of JSON - and the reason on stderr is what the model
// reads next.
//
// What this hook trusts: the adoption.json COMMITTED ON THE BASE BRANCH (ADOPTION_BASE from the
// runner), never the working-tree copy, because the worker can edit the tree. The tree copy is
// the fallback when the base has none, and the receipt says which one was used.
//
// A counter per session caps the blocks (config.maxStopBlocks, default 6). After that the session
// is allowed to end and the runner reads the state file to mark the phase blocked. Without the
// cap, one defect the model cannot fix would burn the whole night on a loop.
//
// Every invocation leaves a receipt in .claude/night/stop-gate-<session>.json: what it checked,
// what it decided, why. The canary and the morning report read them.
//
// Daytime (ADOPTION_RUN unset): exits 0 immediately. The gate is still yours to run.
