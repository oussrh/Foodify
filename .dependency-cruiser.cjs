/**
 * The import graph, checked instead of described (CODE-5). Copy to the repository root.
 *
 * The first five rules are the same on every repository. The rules under "the boundary map"
 * are the arrows of CLAUDE.md §3 that must not exist, one rule each: edit them to this
 * repository's directories and delete the example. A violation that is there today goes into
 * `.dependency-cruiser-known-violations.json` (`npx depcruise src --baseline`), which the gate
 * passes with `--ignore-known` and which may only shrink - the tool's own per-finding debt,
 * the same principle as the ratchet's `debt`. Regenerating the baseline when a number rose
 * is what `check-direction.mjs` refuses at night.
 *
 * Run: `npx depcruise src --config .dependency-cruiser.cjs --ignore-known --output-type err`
 *      (exit code = number of error-severity violations; the gate treats non-zero as red)
 * Graph: `npx depcruise src --config .dependency-cruiser.cjs --output-type mermaid > docs/graph.mmd`
 *
 * @type {import('dependency-cruiser').IConfiguration}
